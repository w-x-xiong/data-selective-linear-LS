# data-selective-linear-LS

This is the source code of the data-selective linear LS algorithm associated with our IEEE SL paper:

W. Xiong et al., "Data-Selective Least Squares Methods for Elliptic Localization With NLOS Mitigation," in IEEE Sensors Letters, 
vol. 5, no. 7, pp. 1-4, July 2021, Art no. 7002304, doi: 10.1109/LSENS.2021.3087422.

You could use the code for your comparisons at will, as long as the paper above is included as a reference in your manuscript.

---Corrigendum for the paper---

Note that the definition of $\bm{m}$ in the paper is wrong. Its elements should be $\{ \epsilon_{m,l} \}$ instead.
